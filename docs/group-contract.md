#CS 4230 - Group Project

----------


#####7 November 2016 Group Contract 
<br>
<p>
Twitter Thing - Problem Statement
We want to implement the Twitter API to focus tweets based off our interests. </p>
<p>
Twitter is filled with vast amounts of random information; most of which is irrelevant to our interests. This makes it difficult to sift through everything to find relevant information.</p>

####We will use Scrum Methodology to implement the API that will filter information.<br><br>
Team Structure and Communication
Andrew Lane will take the lead on this project as he is most knowledgeable about the API. Arthur Brennan will act as Scrum Master. His duties will include organizing sprint planning and sprint reviews on a bi-weekly basis. He will conduct regular stand-up meetings and handle any administrative duties needed such as organizing Trello and completing any necessary documentation. The whole team will work together on all aspects of the project. However, each developer will be assigned to a specific story/task.

The team will communicate using Slack and the Canvas Group Page as well as the above-mentioned sprint planning, review, and stand-up meetings.

##Code Standards

The code standards are as follows:

 	- Travis CI (with Maven)
		- Each build will either pass or fail based on:
			- Syntax
			- Unit Tests
			- Integration Tests
	- IntelliJ Default Java/HTML/Spring formatter (Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + L)
	- MVC
	- Highly cohesive, loosely coupled, modular code

##Conflict Resolution and Decision Making Process

All forms of decision making will be done as a team. Final say of all decisions will be handle by a vote. Conflict resolution will be handled by vote as well. Each person in the dispute will make a case for their argument. After hearing each side out, the team will take a vote. Should this fail to resolve the conflict, Prof. Trevor Marsh will act as our outside arbitrator. He will consider each side of the conflict and make a final decision. The team must adhere to this decision.

##Technology Stack

The teamâ€™s technology stack will be as followed:

- 	Spring
- 	Twitter API
- 	Maven
- 	AWS RDS
- 	Azure Webapp
- 	JQuery
